# APT Casino - Polygon Amoy

A decentralized casino platform built on Polygon Amoy Testnet with Pyth Entropy (via Arbitrum Sepolia) for provably fair gaming/gambling

## 🎮 The Story Behind APT Casino

A few days ago, I was exploring some transactions on Etherscan, where I saw an advertisement of https://stake.com/ offering a 200% bonus on first deposits. I deposited 120 USDT and received 360 USDT in total balance in their custodial wallet.

When I started playing, I discovered I could only bet $1 per game and couldn't increase the amount. After contacting customer support, I learned I had been trapped by hidden "wager limits" tied to the bonus scheme. To withdraw my original deposit, I would need to play $12,300 worth of games!

In a desperate attempt to recover my funds, I played different games all night - roulette, mines, spin wheel and lost everything.

This frustrating experience inspired APT Casino: a combination of GameFi, AI, and DeFi where users can enjoy casino games in a safe, secure, and transparent environment that doesn't scam its users.

## 🎯 The Problem

The traditional online gambling industry suffers from several issues:

- **Unfair Game Outcomes**: 99% of platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play
- **High Fees**: Exorbitant charges for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay
- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies**: Conditions that prevent users from accessing their funds
- **Misleading Bonus Schemes**: Trapping users with unrealistic wagering requirements
- **Lack of True Asset Ownership**: Centralized control over user funds
- **User Adoption Barriers**: Complexity of using wallets creates friction for web2 users
- **No Social Layer**: Lack of live streaming, community chat, and collaborative experiences

## 💡 Our Solution

APT Casino addresses these problems by offering:

- **Provably Fair Gaming**: Powered by Pyth Entropy

    constraints: {
      maxAmount: maxBet,
      validUntil: timeLimit,
      allowedGames: gameTypes
    }
  });
};

// Execute batch bets through delegation
const executeBatchBets = async (bets) => {
  return delegationRegistry.executeDelegatedTransactions({
    delegationId,
    transactions: bets.map(bet => ({
      to: bet.gameContract,
      data: bet.data,
      value: bet.amount
    }))
